# Banter

**Your party just got a lot louder.**

Banter is a comedy engine for World of Warcraft Anniversary Classic that turns every dungeon run, every wipe, every stolen loot drop into a punchline. Choose a persona. Enter a dungeon. Let the chaos write itself.

## What It Does

Banter watches what happens in-game — deaths, wipes, low health, loot rolls, combat, crowd control, and more — then fires off fully-voiced comedic commentary in chat as if your character has *opinions*.

No macros. No keybinds. No effort. Just laughs.

## 4 Personas. 4 Very Different Problems.

| Persona | Voice | Sample |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Pirate** | Loud, drunk, dangerously optimistic | *"THAT LOOT BE MINE BY BIRTHRIGHT! ...I were born on a boat, everythin' on boats be mine!"* |
| **Warrior** | Gruff sergeant who's seen too much | *"I've buried better soldiers than you. Stand up. Die later."* |
| **Ninja** | Zen minimalist, unnervingly calm | *"I do not cry. Water simply... leaves my face. Unrelated."* |
| **Neutral** | Dry-wit gamer who broke the fourth wall | *"The spirit healer knows me by name now. We're past small talk."* |

## 12 Triggers. 4 Rarity Tiers. Hundreds of Lines.

Every trigger pulls from **COMMON**, **UNCOMMON**, **RARE**, and **MYTHIC** pools — so the best lines are the ones you almost never hear.

| Trigger | Fires When... |
|---------|---------------|
| Player Dead | A party member dies |
| Wipe | Everyone dies (naturally) |
| Health Low | Someone drops below 25% HP |
| Mana Zero | A caster goes OOM |
| Loot | Someone wins a roll |
| Enter Instance | You zone into a dungeon |
| Interrupt | Someone kicks a cast |
| Periodic Damage | Someone stands in fire. Again. |
| Combat Start | A pull happens |
| Mob Kill | Something dies |
| Crowd Control | Someone gets CC'd |
| Ambient | Nothing's happening (yet) |

## Chat Filter — Talk Like Your Persona

Turn on the **Persona Chat Filter** and your own typed messages get transformed before they're sent. Every word you type passes through your persona's dialect engine — pirate slang, warrior jargon, ninja zen-speak, or dry gamer sarcasm.

Type: `"Nice job on that pull everyone"`
Send as Pirate: `"Yarr! Nice job on that pull ye scallywags, arr!"`

Bypass anytime with `!` prefix or hold Shift.

## Multi-Addon Sync

Running Banter with friends? The addon automatically discovers other Banter users in your group, elects a scene leader, and staggers responses so everyone's persona reacts without stepping on each other.

No setup. No configuration. Just more chaos.
